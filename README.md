Shoes Tone Matrix
=================

Simple Tone Matrix on Shoes. :)

Original flash based ToneMatrix is [here](http://lab.andre-michelle.com/tonematrix).


**Note:**   
I've hacked [bleything/midiator](http://github.com/bleything/midiator/tree/master) to pick up the core MIDI interface part. :)   
I know I can use MIDIator gem with Shoes. But I want to understand the basic MIDI usage and this tiny Shoes app doesn't need the big codes.

Shoes Tone Matrix v0.1 includes the drivers for Mac and Linux. But I have no Mac and Linux... :(   
**Hope someone attempt to run v0.1 on his/her Mac or Linux and let me know what happen.** ;-)
